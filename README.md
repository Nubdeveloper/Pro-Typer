__Recent Fix__ – Android 15 Window Inset Issue

After testing on Android 15, we noticed an issue where window insets (such as the keyboard and navigation bar) were incorrectly handled, causing layout shifts.

### Fix Implemented:

Updated WindowInsetsController handling to align with Android 15 behavior.

Ensured input fields and buttons adjust properly when the keyboard appears.

Verified smooth animations and transitions after the fix.
